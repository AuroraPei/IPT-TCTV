> **Abstract:** *Infrared small target detection is a challenging task in the computer vision field due to factors such as target scale variations and strong clutter. The existing infrared patch tensor (IPT) models achieve good detection performance but still have several limitations, such as inaccurate background modeling results and poor robustness against noise. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we propose a new IPT model (dubbed as IPT-TCTV) by fully exploiting prior background knowledge. We construct an improved spatial-temporal (STT) model by sliding a 3-D window, which could better preserve the spatial correlation and temporal continuity of multiframe infrared images in the constructed tensor. Specifically, a joint low-rank and local smoothness regularization, i.e., tensor correlated total variation (TCTV), is utilized to characterize the background since the background exhibits not only the low-rank property but also the local smoothness property, without introducing additional trade-off parameters. Furthermore, considering the effect of edge structures, the \textit{l}$_{2,1}$ norm is adopted as a noise constraint to eliminate strong residuals, which can help to extract real targets from the background with more precision. Finally, we design an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach to solve the proposed model. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets illustrate that our IPT-TCTV model can achieve better detection performance than other state-of-the-art methods in various real scenes.*

## Overall Framework

Overall framework of the proposed method. (a) The input infrared images. (b) The 3-D sliding window spatial-temporal tensor (3DSWSTT) model. \textit{Step1}: The input images are extended by padding the edges. \textit{Step2}: A series of stereo patch tensors are obtained by sliding a 3-D window from left to right and top to bottom. \textit{Step3}: The spatial-temporal patch tensor $\mathcal{O}$ is constructed by collecting the centered patch tensor and its 3 Ã— 3 adjacent patch tensors as neighborhoods. (c) The TCTV model. The constructed patch tensor $\mathcal{O}$ is separated into three modules including the background $\mathcal{B}$, the target $\mathcal{T}$ and the noise $\mathcal{N}$ patch tensors by TCTV model and solved iteratively by ADMM approach, detailed in Algorithm 1. (d) The detected background and target images are produced by tensor reconstructions.
